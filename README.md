# HackathonGamification
A website for the 2025 UGA Hackathon Truist Gamification challenge
Teammembers:
Dante Martinez & Tate Matthews

Purpose:
Website intended to help educate business owners about crucial financial information through a gamified format. 
Games include a tycoon style game where users can hire workers, buy goods, and advertise to manage their business 
and learn about EBITDA, and a matching game where users can strengthen their definitions of and learn about various 
aspects of a balancing sheet and what business actions may affect it.

Tools Utilized:
-Used Copilot a limited number of times to aid in code, primarily used to help with CSS and speed up monotonous tasks
-Used ChatGPT to broaden our understanding of HTML
-Frequently referenced w3schools.com
-GridGarden to learn about formatting with CSS

-Problems that your team ran into and how your team overcame them:
-Coming into this challenge neither teammate had a strong financial background and thus a very limited view of how to
approach this problem. We set aside much of the first night to learn and discuss possible approaches to ensure that we
not only had an idea we believed we could reasonably complete, but also one we could be proud of.
-CSS was a weakpoint for both teammembers, and with no one else to lean on or teach us we had to turn to outside resources
to strengthen our understanding an make sure that the project looked presentable.
-We wanted to use Auth0 to set up authorization and accounts for the project, however between a lack of time and a poor
understanding of how to implement them into a JavaScript environment, neither teammembers were able to make it work. Tate
also made an attempt with FireBase, though it too was unsuccessful.

Frameworks utililized: N/A
